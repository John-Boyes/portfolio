Again plenty of articles out there about this step but one specific FL tip: The translation must be both &#8220;certified&#8221;, notarized and must include language that goes something like &#8220;Translation is certified as true and accurate. Translator attests that they have knowledge of the two languages, regularly translates as a normal course of business and their translation is accurate. Translator has no previous or current interest in the motor vehicle.&#8221; You can work with your import service to do this but I used an online service that provides notarization to avoid any issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Schedule your VIN inspection with the specific DMV person for your region. Yes, I said a specific person: not a notary, officer or other DMV employee. A special affidavit is required to be filled and signed by the person who does this at the Motorist Services Regional Office. Look up your DMV region at this site and call the specific phone number to set up an appointment: Locations - Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is usually the same person that handles rebuilds, kit cars, etc. This person reviewed my paperwork I sent via email and set up an inspection 3 days later. After you get an appointment you can then schedule your title appt. ideally right after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tow your car to the DMV to be physically inspected. I attempted many times to get a temp tag to no avail. They are only giving these out in person so if you&#8217;re dead-set to receive one you&#8217;ll have to schedule an earlier appointment and hope they give you one. Otherwise, this is a regular VIN inspection. They did not check my car for lights, emissions, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Head to your title appt., pay sales tax and fees and receive your plates! They did ask for a bill of sale from the import service so make sure to bring that along with your usual stack of forms. While not required, doing your title at the same office that handles VIN inspection is preferred since they have more experience with import cars coming through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: FL has special requirements for translation of titles and requires a specific inspection at the regional DMV office.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You will need to look up your local county’s DMV website to register in Florida\n<ul>\n<li>See also, Kai’s Kei’s Guide in the EATZ Group’s Files tab.\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/download/2369946809837520/Kai%27s%20Keis%20Guide%20to%20Register%20JDM%20Import%20%281%29.pdf\">https://www.facebook.com/download/2369946809837520/Kai%27s%20Keis%20Guide%20to%20Register%20JDM%20Import%20%281%29.pdf</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h6><em></em><em>Kei Cars and Trucks</em></h6>\n\n\n\n<p>Florida has no laws regarding the legality of Kei vehicles on the street or highways, therefore, they should fall under the standard rules for importing a car.

In order for a certificate of title to be issued, the department requires any motor vehicle imported by a registered Missouri motor vehicle dealer, or an individual, whose vehicle is not manufactured for importation into the United States, to be inspected by a member of the Missouri State Highway Patrol. At the time of the inspection, the Missouri State Highway Patrol will complete a Vehicle Examination Certificate, DOR Form 551. This form indicates that the vehicle identification number has been verified and is correct.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some motor vehicles which are purchased by Missouri residents in another country and imported into the United States are manufactured for importation into the United States and conform to all legal standards. The ROBIN CARNAHAN (1/30/12) CODE OF STATE REGULATIONS 17 Secretary of State Chapter 23—Motor Vehicle 12 CSR 10-23 ownership document for these vehicles is usually a Manufacturer’s Statement of Origin similar to the type issued for a motor vehicle constructed by an American manufacturer.\n<ol>\n<li>Any application for title to a motor vehicle imported into the United States which is accompanied by a Manufacturer’s Statement of Origin need not be accompanied by a DOR Form 551(B).&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If problems are encountered at the time the application is entered into the Department of Revenue’s computer, the central office will inform the applicant to contact the Missouri State Highway Patrol to request that they inspect the vehicle and complete a Vehicle Examination Certificate.
