Recently, I worked on a project to set up a hot desk where users can plug in their laptops and start creating training videos at the push of a button. For simple screen recording, users can connect and press Record/Stop on the ATEM ISO. For live streaming or comprehensive training course creation, they can use OBS in conjunction with the ATEM ISO and a stream deck to control audio, video, transitions, images, and more. Additionally, I set up a budget-friendly telestrator using a Wacom Tablet and a virtual whiteboard with an iPad. This modular and versatile setup ensures that anyone, regardless of their skill level, can achieve professional-quality recordings and streams reliably.",
